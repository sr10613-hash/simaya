    <h1>SLOW LORIS</h1>
    <img src="slowloris.jpg" alt=" ">
    <p>A slow loris is a small mammal that grows up to 18 to 38 cm and weighs around 2.1 kg. Slow lorises are very close to being
    extinct, as their population has been declined by at least 80% over the last 24 years. Slow lorises are deadly because even with a 
    single bite, you would get venom. </p>
