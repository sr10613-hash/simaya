    <p>A golden poison frog is a amphibian that grows up to 5-6cm and weighs around 30 grams kg. Golden poison frogs are deadly because
    their venom is extremely poisonous, as a single specimen measuring two inches has enough venom to kill ten grown men. Even though
    the golden poison frog is highly poisonous, they are quite endangered.</p>
